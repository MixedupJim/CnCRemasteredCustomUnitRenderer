# CnCRemasteredCustomUnitRenderer
A Unity Project to create custom unit graphics for Command &amp; Conquer remastered

This software is a Unity3D project to help you create new units for the remastered Command & Conquer games.

It essentially allows you to drop a 3D model into the scene and the camera will spin around the model taking snapshots from the correct angles. These snapshots will be saved out in the correct format for use in a mod.
